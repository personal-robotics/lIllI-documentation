# lIllI-documentation
Documentation for the lIllI humanoid robot.

lIlli is a humanoid robot developed by Per Salkowitsch for Personal Robotics. It's hardware is heavily based on Halley and Poppy. 
The pupose of this robot is to give people the possibility to explore the world of robotics without great financial investments. 

The robot can be laser cut from 4mm material and is assembed using standard R/C servo motors. These motors come in various strengths and can be choosen depending on the planned purpose. 
The motors are controlled using two PCA9685 boards.

The main structure of the robot is provided by the laser cut parts. These parts are metric and use standard M3 bolts for the hingeing of the joints. 
We also sell the robot as a kit, which helps us finance our work. 
You can buy it here.

The main goal is to make it work with ROS. However, we also provide configuration files for myrobotlab. Please note that myrobotlab is not actively supported and thus the config files might need some adjustment when myrobotlab gets updated.
